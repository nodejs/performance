## Collaborators

The Performance Team GitHub repository is
maintained by the team and additional Collaborators who are added by the
team on an ongoing basis.

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are made
Collaborators and given commit-access to the project. These
individuals are identified by the team and their addition as
Collaborators is discussed during the weekly meeting.

_Note:_ If you make a significant contribution and are not considered
for commit-access log an issue or contact a team member directly and it
will be brought up in the next meeting.

Modifications of the contents of the Performance Team repository are made on
a collaborative basis. Anybody with a GitHub account may propose a
modification via pull request and it will be considered by the project
Collaborators. All pull requests must be reviewed and accepted by a
Collaborator with sufficient expertise who is able to take full
responsibility for the change. In the case of pull requests proposed
by an existing Collaborator, an additional Collaborator is required
for sign-off. Consensus should be sought if additional Collaborators
participate and there is disagreement around a particular
modification. See _Consensus Seeking Process_ below for further detail
on the consensus model used for governance.

Collaborators may opt to elevate significant or controversial
modifications, or modifications that have not found consensus to the
team for discussion by assigning the ***performance-agenda*** tag to a pull
request or issue. The team should serve as the final arbiter where
required.

For the current list of Collaborators, see the project
[README.md](./README.md#current-project-team-members).

## Team Membership

Team seats are not time-limited.  There is no fixed size of the team.
However, the expected target is between 6 and 12, to ensure adequate
coverage of important areas of expertise, balanced with the ability to
make decisions efficiently.

There is no specific set of requirements or qualifications for the
membership beyond these rules.

The team may add additional members by unanimous consensus.

A team member may be removed from the Performance Team by voluntary 
resignation, or by unanimous consensus of all other team members.

Changes to team membership should be posted in the agenda, and may be
suggested as any other agenda item (see "Team Meetings" below).

If an addition or removal is proposed during a meeting, and the full
team is not in attendance to participate, then the addition or removal
is added to the agenda for the subsequent meeting.  This is to ensure
that all members are given the opportunity to participate in all
membership decisions.  If a team member is unable to attend a meeting
where a planned membership decision is being made, then their consent
is assumed.

No more than 1/3 of the team members may be affiliated with the same
employer.  If removal or resignation of a team member, or a change of
employment by a team member, creates a situation where more than 1/3 of
the team membership shares an employer, then the situation must be
immediately remedied by the resignation or removal of one or more team
members affiliated with the over-represented employer(s).

## Team Meetings

The team meets weekly on a Zoom On Air. A designated moderator
approved by the team runs the meeting. Each meeting should be
published to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/nodejs-foundation/streams).

Items are added to the team agenda that are considered contentious or
are modifications of governance, contribution policy, team membership,
or release process.

The intention of the agenda is not to approve or review all patches;
that should happen continuously on GitHub and be handled by the larger
group of Collaborators.

Any community member or contributor can ask that something be added to
the next meeting's agenda by logging a GitHub Issue. Any Collaborator,
team member or the moderator can add the item to the agenda by adding
the ***performance-agenda*** tag to the issue.

Prior to each team meeting the moderator will share the Agenda with
members of the team. Team members can add any items they like to the
agenda at the beginning of each meeting. The moderator and the team
cannot veto or remove items.

The team may invite persons or representatives from certain projects to
participate in a non-voting capacity.

The moderator is responsible for summarizing the discussion of each
agenda item and sends it as a pull request after the meeting.

## Consensus Seeking Process

The Performance Team follows a [Consensus Seeking][] decision-making model.

When an agenda item has appeared to reach a consensus the moderator
will ask "Does anyone object?" as a final call for dissent from the
consensus.

If an agenda item cannot reach a consensus a team member can call for
either a closing vote or a vote to table the issue to the next
meeting. The call for a vote must be seconded by a majority of the team
or else the discussion will continue. Simple majority wins.

Note that changes to team membership require unanimous consensus.  See
"Team Membership" above.
