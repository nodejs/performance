## Agenda

## Announcements

*Extracted from **performance-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

Anonrig: Proposal to create a C++ URL parser and embed it directly on Node.js

### nodejs/node

* Start time performance regression when upgrading from 16.x to 18.x [#45662](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/45662)
  * It seems fixed. Waiting for release on v19.x and active release lines backport.
  * The backport needs a rewrite of the feature

### nodejs/performance

* Add support for V8 fast call [#23](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/23)
  * We need a volunteer to write a doc for this

* Buffer.toString vs TextDecoder [#18](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/18)
  * For small strings it’s still slow due to JS -> C++ bridge costs.
  * ronagy: Would be good to include V8 Fast call to Buffer.toString too

* fetch [#11](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/11)
* WHATWG Streams [#9](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/9)
  * Rafael did an investigation and opened a PR that improves the undici.fetch benchmark by ~30% by reusing Errors
  * `makeTransferable` is slow due to some prototype manipulations. We can achieve approximately 30% of improvement on that path.
  * Another possible choice it to optimize Error.captureStackTrace which is quite expensive
  * We might consider implementing the Webstreams on the C++ side. We’re not sure how feasible this is considering the main usage of webstreams is over fetch, and fetch is for compatibility not for performance. 

* Buffer.(read|write)(U)Int(LE|BE)(8|16|32) [#2](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/2)
  * ronagy: Happy to provide a PoC.

* Do not parse numbers on url parsers - ipv4[#36](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/36)
  * Current EndsInNumber implementation parses every number, but it is unnecessary for validation only purposes. 
    There is a potential 25-30% room for improvement, and Yagiz is happy to guide any volunteer.
