## Agenda

## Announcements

 * Node URL got ~30% faster thanks to Miguel (referencing https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/46227)

### nodejs/node

* Start time performance regression when upgrading from 16.x to 18.x [#45662](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/45662)
  * The issue is fixed on the main branch and Node 19. 
  * Working on a backport to Node 18.

### nodejs/performance

* Node errors are very slow to create [#40](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/40)
  * A lot of dependencies are starting to *not* use cancellable apis because of the performance issues.
  * Custom optimization for abort signal/abort event can be done (@ronag)
  * Adding and removing the event handler might be the issue.
  * If someone is interested in this, Robert is happy to guide them.
 
* Module resolution [#39](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/39)
  * Marvin diagnosed an issue with file system operations and the impact.
  * **Very** big part of module resolution is lost on creating errors.
  * Async methods might be improved.
  * Yagiz is happy to add `fs.isFile` kind of API if needed.
  * Joyee has some insights/recommendations for the fs.statSync improvement.
  * The “throw and catch an error even when it’s useless” behavior has an old deprecation TODO. If we remove it then the performance issue would also go away.
  * It’s possible to add options parameter to `fs.existsSync` for checking if it’s a file/directory.
 
* Add support for V8 fast call [#23](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/23)
  * Can we add v8 support to Node-API?

* Buffer.toString vs TextDecoder [#18](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/18)
  * Let’s improve the docs to use TextDecoder for certain cases of Buffer.toString

* fetch [#11](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/11)
  * Rafael has invested some time on this, and improved it.

* WHATWG Streams [#9](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/9)
  * Skipping because Rafael is not at the meeting.

* Buffer.(read|write)(U)Int(LE|BE)(8|16|32) [#2](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/2)
  * Robert invested some time on this, and theoretically it is possible to use DataView to improve writeInt32LE and readInt32LE implementations.
  * James (@jasnell) might help with this.
