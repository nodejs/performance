## Agenda

## Announcements

[Ada](https://github.com/ada-url/ada), the new URL parse will be added to Node.js as dependency in order to increase speed by 78 %, fetch will become faster too ðŸŽ‰

Marvin released a really good blog post on https://marvinh.dev/blog/speeding-up-javascript-ecosystem-part-3/. 

*Extracted from **performance-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/node

* Start time performance regression when upgrading from 16.x to 18.x [#45662](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/45662)
19.x changes are already merged
There is an ongoing work to port the changes to 16.x and 18.x (lead by @joyeecheung)
This item will be removed from the agenda
### nodejs/performance

* AbortSignal is slow [#44](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/44)
Reached out to RxJS folks. There are some discussions and agreements ongoing, but after checking the performance improvements there were no major upgrades
PR from Santigo (@santigimeno) improves the performance by 20% - https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/46527 
Ongoing discussion about further changes that could improve the performance even more include moving `Event.isTrusted` to the prototype and not setting `__proto__: null`. The former might break the spec. 
Recommendation escalate to WinterCG group
* Node errors are very slow to create [#40](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/40)
This item will be removed from the agenda
* Module resolution [#39](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/39)
There is an open PR relevant (pending from benchmark)
Suggestion: Implement it fully in C++. Input value is a string, return value is a boolean, so this would lend itself to use v8 fast paths
@tony-go will take a look at it
We could expose it to user land later if we found a use case for it
* fetch [#11](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/11)
We move from very slow to just slow in terms of performance
There are more open opportunities, but letâ€™s see how Ada will impact on the performance and then we can reevaluate the situation.
This item will be removed from the agenda, and the issue will be closed. We can reopen the issue if needed.
* WHATWG Streams [#9](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/9)
[Last update from Rafael](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/9#issuecomment-1370136019)
We will discuss it again in the next meeting
* Buffer.(read|write)(U)Int(LE|BE)(8|16|32) [#2](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/2)
This item will be removed from the agenda
