### nodejs/performance

* Performance of WHATWG ReadableStream.read() [#82](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/82)
  * We are a little bit slower in comparison with Bun and Deno
  * It will be nice to see if Deno/Bun is using native implementation or JS.
* Improve legacy CJS resolve #73
  * The current approach is to use `simdjson` to perform the JSON parsing and increase the performance. See: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/47991
  * @H4ad is working on this issue from now on
* MakeCallback is very slow [#24](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/24)
  * We reached out to more people about it, including the TSC meeting.
  * We need to do a deeper investigation
  * This approach made by the `uWebSockets.js` is interesting. See: https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/24#issuecomment-1559993286
  * Daniel & Yagiz will work soon in a new library to resolve the Websockets layer (compatible with Node.js)

* fetch [#11](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/11)
  * No news, we will remove it from the agenda
  * Benchmarks and more info is needed before we can make any progress. 
  * Contributions from the community are more than welcome here.
