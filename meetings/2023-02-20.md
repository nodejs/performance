## Agenda

## Announcements

- The new URL parser will be released this week!
- It was a productive week for all of us! Other improvements had been made by the group members (Ruben, Joyee and multiple other collaborators) based on separated issues
- Santiago is planning to do a new PR for event creation this week

*Extracted from **performance-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/performance

* getLibuvNow is slow [#49](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/49)
  - Seems that there is a fix for it, related to timers (https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/46579) with v8 fastApi. (Thanks to joyee!)
It will be removed from the agenda
* AbortSignal pattern is slow [#44](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/44)
  - Ruben created a PR to reduce error creation duration by 86-166% (Amazing work!) 
  - There are several issues with AbortSignal Pattern
    - Emitting events is slow (Santiago will open a PR to improve this)
    - Adding and removing event listeners in event Targets. This is actually the main issue. New issue: https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/60 
  - We have specific perf benchmarks for events (adding and removing) in https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/main/benchmark/events/eventtarget.js, seems like we should potentially update them for EventTarget addition/removal.
* Module resolution [#39](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/39)
  - Yagiz did some research and a PR related to it (https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/46652) - Not yet merged. We should add a caching layer once is merged
  - There is a pending PR for changing off threading loaders. Until it gets merged, Yagiz’s pull request will be on hold to avoid git conflicts. 
* WHATWG Streams [#9](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/9)
  - There is an option to improve this by moving the core logic to C++, similar to the work done by Deno and Bun, but requires extensive work. For the time being, we can close this issue.
  - This item will be removed from the agenda

## Q&A, Other
- Yagiz opened several PRs related to URL parsing and he discovered a happy path that has a more performing approach. There was a discussion around it with Daniel as this implementation may have a more complex implementation as hidden cost.  It is an early stage yet to build a consensus.
