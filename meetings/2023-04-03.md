## Agenda

## Announcements

* Ada v2 is released. Announcement post is available at http://yagiz.co/announcing-ada-url-parser-v2-0/
* V8 11.3 brings `String.prototype.toWellFormed()` support with 70-80% faster `toUSVString`
* Increasing the default watermark size for version 20. It provides a performance boost! 

*Extracted from **performance-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/performance

* add/remove handlers are slow on EventTarget [#60](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/60)
  * It would be great to add a fast path for AbortSignal to have only one `abort` listener.
  * There is no one working on it right now.
  * Debadree attempted on adding a hashmap based approach but did not help with any performance impacts.
  * It would be great to have a benchmark for adding and removing a single event listener (the current benchmarks adds multiple listeners and then dispatches), because the proposed benchmark would never traverse the linkedlist.
* Session proposals for the next Collaborator Summit - what should we submit [#64](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/64)
* Bun & Deno Comparison [#55](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/55)
  * Yagiz proposed adding his own performance benchmarks to the performance repository. Will keep this for visibility.
* AbortSignal pattern is slow [#44](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/44)
  * Closing it since it is a duplicate of add/remove handlers for EventTarget
* Module resolution [#39](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/39)
  * Put this on hold until off-thread loader pull request is landed.
* EventTarget [#32](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/32)
  * Closing it due to Santiago’s amazing contributions.
* fetch [#11](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/11)
  * Robert: I don’t know where to start optimizing. There’s more work to be done. Maybe we can ask Rafael on making a new analysis on undici fetch?
